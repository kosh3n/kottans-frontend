## Git та GitHub
Well, that was interesting. Now I think I know how to work with Git better than I used to. There were also a lot of things that are new to me, like patch and fetch commands. I found these two very useful and saving a lot of time, especially the last one. And I've learned what to do with merge conflict because until now I have never faced it before. Will definitely use all new commands in the future. Besides I guess I will read more about merge and rebase differences because this thing I still not quite understood :c

## Linux, Command Line, HTTP Tools

<strong>1. Linux Survival (4 modules)</strong>
This was really hard for me, mainly 3 & 4 modules. Most every command was new to me. There were some commands which I knew before from the Git (like mkdir, cd, ls,  rm...) but the rest of the things were completely new:
* File security. You can read, write or/and execute the file if it's a programm. the owner in Linux seems to be like administration rights in windows. For changing right permission you shoul use <strong>chmod</strong>;
* The difference between <strong>find ~ -name "poem*"</strong> and <strong>find . -name "poem*"</strong> is in that if you're not sure whether the file is called "poem", "poems", or even "poem-favorite" you can use '*'. But if you are already in the right directory, you can type command with "find .". It's just saving time;
* The hard disk file system in Linux and Windows is different. On a Linux system, however, there is only one directory tree. I find it not very suitable for a common windows user (like me). 
* <strong>grep</strong> is used to find patterns in data (is one of the most obscure and easily-forgotten command names in Linux). 

I'm going to practice with these commands and hope to using them in future.

<strong>2. HTTP: Протокол, який повинен розуміти кожний веб-розробник - Частина 1</strong>

- <em>What's was new:</em>  
I knew only GET/POST methods. Now I know that there are others: PUT, DELETE, HEAD, TRACE and OPTIONS. 

- <em>Thing(-s) that amazed you:</em>  
That HTTP Responses have a lot of information: status line, headers and body. Every response from the server will have a status code. The status code is important and tells the client how to interpret the server response. There' 1**, 2**, 3**, 4** and 5** statuses.

- <em>Thing(-s) that you are going to use in future:</em>  
I have studied a bit of Node.js and Express so I hope that I will use received knowledge in future work.

<strong>3. HTTP: Протокол, який повинен розуміти кожний веб-розробник - Частина 2</strong>

- <em>What's was new:</em>  
Almost everything. But most of all how does the Authentication and the Caching working. 

- <em>Thing(-s) that amazed you:</em>  
That you can control the cachability both from the server and client side.

- <em>Thing(-s) that you are going to use in future:</em>  
I have studied a bit of Node.js and Express so I hope that I will use received knowledge in future work.

## Git Collaboration

I've heard and wanted to try learngitbranching for a long time. It turned out to be quite heavy for me. There was two very difficult themes for me: rebase (cherry-pick I understand better) and the advanced topics on both sides. 

-<em>What's was new:</em>  
Have never heard out hit describe before.

-<em>Thing(-s) that amazed you: </em>  
 I like tag command, find it very useful.
 
-<em>Thing(-s) that you are going to use in future:</em>  
git tag, git cherry-pick, git fetch, git rebase.
